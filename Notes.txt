Dynamic Typing:
We need NOT to specify the data type. Unlike the other languages where we specifically mention the data type for a variable.

python supports Dynamic typing where we NEED NOT to specify the data type explicitly.

Static typing: Viceversa of Dynamic typing. we need to specify the data type of the vairable which indicates the data we store in that variable.

Keywords:

Python is a case sensitive programming language.

In programming a keyword is a word that is reserved by a programming language because it has a special meaning. Keywords can be commands or parameters. Every programming language has a set of Keywords that cannot be used as variable names.

Python provides a module called keyword (note the lowercase "k") that contains a list of reserved keywords in Python.

There are 33 keywords in python.
Keywords list include:
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Using these keywords as variable names will result in errors.

Identifier:
Python Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
Rules for setting Identifier:
1. Only start with alphabet or _(Down slash)
2. Followed by 0 or more letter,_ and digits
3. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

Types of software:
1. Static software (Uni Directional)
2. Dynamic software //This highlights the importance of input function which help us to take input from the user.

Whenever we use input function the programmer will always get the input in the form of string.

Type function:
This will help us to know about the data type of the value which we give.

Type conversions:
1. Implicit 
2. Explicit 

int function:
This can be used to convert data type into integer.
Strings with float value cannot be converted into integer.

Ex: int(4.5) this throws an error.
Type conversions are not permanent operations.


Literals:
It is a raw data given to a variable. In python we have four types of literals. They are:
1. Numeric literal
2. String literal
3. Boolean literal
4. Special literal

Numeric Literal:
a. integer
b. float
c. complex

0b1010 #Binary "0b" represent Binary notation
100 #Decimal
0o310 #Octal "0o" represent Octal notation
0x12C #Hexadecimal "0x" represent Hexadecimal notation

Scientific notation = 1.5e2 "e2" represent exponent i.e. 1.5 * 10^2
Scientific notation = 1.5e-2 "e-2" represent exponent i.e. 1.5 * 10^-2
x = 5j
# real and imaginary part of complex number where x.real is real part and x.imag is imaginary part.

String literals:
a. Single quotes
b. Double quotes
c. Triple quotes //These are used to print multi line text.
There is no particular data type called char in python. Everything in python is considered as string.

Unicode strings are accepted by python. we need to specify the unicode with "u". This help us to print emojis.
Raw string can be printed in python. Generally raw string is used when we want to print html code which consist of many special characters.

Boolean literal:
True indicates '1'.
False indicates '0'.
a = True + 4 //We encounter a Implicit type conversion which result in the value of 'a' as 5.
b = False + 10 //the value of false is Implicitly taken as '0' and the value of 'b' is 10.

Special literal
a = None There is no vairable declaration in py. we use this when we want to declare a varibale and assign none so that ntg is stored in it. This variable remains ideal yet we can use it in future advancements. This is generally helpful in the scenario when we are working with team.

For instance your manager may ask you to declare a variable which he might use later. 
When we declare 0 or anyother value there is a risk of error in our logic. To avoid such situations we use None.

Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Identity Operators
7. Membership Operators

1.Arithmetic Operators: +, -, /, *, %, //(used to convert quotient into integer), x**y(Double star indicate power)

2.Comparison operators(Relational operators): >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

3.Logical Operators: 
AND OR NOT
AND = True when both the values are True
OR = True when atleast one value is True
NOT = It shows the opposite of the current value.

4.Bitwise Operators: useful when working with binary values. These are generally used in image processing.
&-(BITWISE AND) = It return 1 when both a & b are 1.
|(BITWISE OR) = It returns 1 when atleast one value is 1.
>>(LEFT SHIFT) = shift bits to left by the given value
<<(RIGHT SHIFT) = shift bits to right by the given value.
^(XOR) = It compares each bit of two numbers and return 1 if the bits are different. 0 is bits are same. 
~(COMPLIMENT)= turns 0 to 1 and Viceversa

5.Assignment operator: =
It is used to store a value to the variable.

Pre-incremenet and post-increment are not allowed in python.

6.Identity Operator:
This indicate the memory location of the variables.
For instance both the variables may hold the same value yet they are not identical. The memory locations of the variables differ.

If the value of variables is same yet this does not mean that they are at same memory location.

"is" checks if two variables point to the same object (memory location).
For immutable types (like small integers), Python may reuse objects.
For mutable types (like lists), each assignment creates a new object.

7.Membership operator:
This indicate the presence of particular thing(character here) in the container(string here). 
Note: String in the above context is taken as container for understanding.
example below: 
x = "Delhi"
print("D" not in x)

This is applicable for list, dictionaries, sets etc.

Decision control Statements:
Branching: this is the phenomena where we have two directions to move ahead. 
For instance:
In login page if the credentials are correct give the profile/home page. If not throw a error which states incrt credentials.
We do not have any brackets for if - else.
