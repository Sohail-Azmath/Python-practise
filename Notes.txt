Dynamic Typing:
We need NOT to specify the data type. Unlike the other languages where we specifically mention the data type for a variable.

python supports Dynamic typing where we NEED NOT to specify the data type explicitly.

Static typing: Viceversa of Dynamic typing. we need to specify the data type of the vairable which indicates the data we store in that variable.

Keywords:

Python is a case sensitive programming language.

In programming a keyword is a word that is reserved by a programming language because it has a special meaning. Keywords can be commands or parameters. Every programming language has a set of Keywords that cannot be used as variable names.

Python provides a module called keyword (note the lowercase "k") that contains a list of reserved keywords in Python.

There are 33 keywords in python.
Keywords list include:
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Using these keywords as variable names will result in errors.

Identifier:
Python Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
Rules for setting Identifier:
1. Only start with alphabet or _(Down slash)
2. Followed by 0 or more letter,_ and digits
3. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

Types of software:
1. Static software (Uni Directional)
2. Dynamic software //This highlights the importance of input function which help us to take input from the user.

Whenever we use input function the programmer will always get the input in the form of string.

Type function:
This will help us to know about the data type of the value which we give.

Type conversions:
1. Implicit 
2. Explicit 

int function:
This can be used to convert data type into integer.
Strings with float value cannot be converted into integer.

Ex: int(4.5) this throws an error.
Type conversions are not permanent operations.


Literals:
It is a raw data given to a variable. In python we have four types of literals. They are:
1. Numeric literal
2. String literal
3. Boolean literal
4. Special literal

Numeric Literal:
a. integer
b. float
c. complex

0b1010 #Binary "0b" represent Binary notation
100 #Decimal
0o310 #Octal "0o" represent Octal notation
0x12C #Hexadecimal "0x" represent Hexadecimal notation

Scientific notation = 1.5e2 "e2" represent exponent i.e. 1.5 * 10^2
Scientific notation = 1.5e-2 "e-2" represent exponent i.e. 1.5 * 10^-2
x = 5j
# real and imaginary part of complex number where x.real is real part and x.imag is imaginary part.

String literals:
a. Single quotes
b. Double quotes
c. Triple quotes //These are used to print multi line text.
There is no particular data type called char in python. Everything in python is considered as string.

Unicode strings are accepted by python. we need to specify the unicode with "u". This help us to print emojis.
Raw string can be printed in python. Generally raw string is used when we want to print html code which consist of many special characters.

Boolean literal:
True indicates '1'.
False indicates '0'.
a = True + 4 //We encounter a Implicit type conversion which result in the value of 'a' as 5.
b = False + 10 //the value of false is Implicitly taken as '0' and the value of 'b' is 10.

Special literal
a = None There is no vairable declaration in py. we use this when we want to declare a varibale and assign none so that ntg is stored in it. This variable remains ideal yet we can use it in future advancements. This is generally helpful in the scenario when we are working with team.

For instance your manager may ask you to declare a variable which he might use later. 
When we declare 0 or anyother value there is a risk of error in our logic. To avoid such situations we use None.

Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Identity Operators
7. Membership Operators

1.Arithmetic Operators: +, -, /, *, %, //(used to convert quotient into integer), x**y(Double star indicate power)

2.Comparison operators(Relational operators): >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

3.Logical Operators: 
AND OR NOT
AND = True when both the values are True
OR = True when atleast one value is True
NOT = It shows the opposite of the current value.

4.Bitwise Operators: useful when working with binary values. These are generally used in image processing.
&-(BITWISE AND) = It return 1 when both a & b are 1.
|(BITWISE OR) = It returns 1 when atleast one value is 1.
>>(LEFT SHIFT) = shift bits to left by the given value
<<(RIGHT SHIFT) = shift bits to right by the given value.
^(XOR) = It compares each bit of two numbers and return 1 if the bits are different. 0 is bits are same. 
~(COMPLIMENT)= turns 0 to 1 and Viceversa

5.Assignment operator: =
It is used to store a value to the variable.

Pre-incremenet and post-increment are not allowed in python.

6.Identity Operator:
This indicate the memory location of the variables.
For instance both the variables may hold the same value yet they are not identical. The memory locations of the variables differ.

If the value of variables is same yet this does not mean that they are at same memory location.

"is" checks if two variables point to the same object (memory location).
For immutable types (like small integers), Python may reuse objects.
For mutable types (like lists), each assignment creates a new object.

7.Membership operator:
This indicate the presence of particular thing(character here) in the container(string here). 
Note: String in the above context is taken as container for understanding.
example below: 
x = "Delhi"
print("D" not in x)

This is applicable for list, dictionaries, sets etc.

Decision control Statements:
Branching: this is the phenomena where we have two directions to move ahead. 
For instance:
In login page if the credentials are correct give the profile/home page. If not throw a error which states incrt credentials.
We do not have any brackets for if - else.
If BRANCHING increases includes no. of branches we need to use else if.

Note: In python we write "elif" where as in other languages it is written as "else if".

Indentation:
Python does not use semi colon(;) and curly braces unlike other programming language.
Instead the program structure is define by the spaces from the margin. One Decision control statement uses one tab space.
It improves the code readability and help in easy debugging.

Loops:
Best example to understand loops concepts real world usage is:
E - commarce platform(FlipKart)
Zomato (Food Delivery App) etc.

All this display the content in same structure the only change is the content present in it. To display n no. of products we use loops and we fetch the data from database to change the content.

Types of loops:
1. while
2. for 

while <condition>:
    code

Random function:
This is use to select a random number from the given range of numbers.It returns the number from a given range of numbers. It includes the both the numbers.

2. for loop:
range function: this is used to include the numbers in that range. The end value is not included in the range function.
It includes start, stop, step.

range(0,5) = here the start number is 0 and end is 5(which is excluded).
range(5) = The start is assumed as 0 and the end is 5(excluded)
step parameters is used to create the difference in numbers. When step = 2. The difference between consecutive number is 2.

Sequence: 
we have a Sequence of characters, strings, list, tuple & Dictionaries.

For loop iterate on Sequence or range function.
we need not to specify the increment operator or termination condition. We use range function or sequence to end the for loop. 

Tip: When you are unaware about the no. of iterations then use while loop and when you have an clear understanding or no. of iterations use for loop.

Nested loop:
Loops are placed inside the other loops.
The outer loop runs first.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely.

Control flow statements:
Break, continue, pass

Break - use to end the loop and stop iterations.
Useful in linear searching, where we find the number. Once the number is found we break the iteration. This help us in reducing the time complexity.

continue - use to skip the particular iteration. Loop does not terminate here.
Usecase: printing product details which are in stock and skipping the iteration for the product which is out of stock.

pass - It is generally used when you are not aware about the logic. So you use pass.
Pass statement help us to avoid syntax error.
The pass statement in Python is a null operation—it does nothing when executed. It is used as a placeholder in situations where syntactically some code is required, but you do not want any command or code to execute.

Built-in Funciton:
Function: It is a block of code which takes some input and generate output.
1. print() - print function takes the input and gives the output.
2. input() - takes the input from the user. This always accepts the input in the form of string functions we need to convert into other data types using type conversion.
3. type() - this help us to find the data type of the input.

4. Data type functions:
    a.int()- convert into integer datatype
    b.float() - convert into float datatype
    c.list()
    d.tuple()
    e.string

5. abs (absolute function) - this is modulus(use to convert negative values to the positive. In math -(-x) where x is the value given in abs function) function. Useful in machine learning.

6. pow - use to calculate the exponential value of a number. pow(2,3) - 2 ^ 3 = 8

7. min/max - use to find the min & max value.

8. round - use to round off the number to the nearest number and this help us to choose the number of decimal values to be displayed.

9. Divmod = it returns the tuple in two formats. (x//y, x%y) i.e.(integer divison, modulus)

10. bin/oct/hex = this functions give us three type of values such as binary, octal, Hexadecimal.

11. id = used to find the address of memory location.

12. ord = it returns the ASCII value of a alphabet

13. len = length of the given value.

14. sum = it helps in iteration and give the final output.

15. help = to know the original documentation.

MODULE:
It is a file containing set of functions which can be included in our application when necessary.
example:
math,random,os,time

To access the number of functions in a module, type the module name dot(.) then tab.
math = contains all the mathematical functions in it.
random = this contains many functions in it. Most used functions are randint, shuffle.

time = use to ctime(See time)
give the time span i.e. no. of seconds from jan 1 to till now.

time.sleep() = this will create a time gap of number of seconds you mention in sleep and print the nxt statements.

os - getcwd (gets current working directory)
listdir() - list the files in the directory. 

STRINGS:
In all application programming language you will get string as data type. In all the application based programming language we wil use strings to interact with users.
In system software programming language like c does not have string as data type as it is used to interact with the hardware not with users.

In python specifically, strings are a sequence of unicode characters.
ASCII can only represent 128 characters (or 256 in extended ASCII),which covers basic English letters, digits, and a few symbols.

Unicode can represent all characters from all languages(like Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, etc.), as well as emojis, math symbols, and more—over 140,000 characters.

Unicode is needed for global communication, supporting all languages and symbols, while ASCII is only suitable for basic English text. Unicode makes modern software and the internet truly international.

1. Creating strings
2. Accessing Strings
3. Adding chars to strings
4. Editing Strings
5. Deleting Strings
6. Operations on Strings
7. String Functions

1. Creating Strings:
We can create strings using single, Double and multiple inverted commas.
""" - used to create a multi line strings.

2. Accessing strings:
Indexing & slicing - used to access string characters from the string.
Indexing is used to obtain a character at that index. 
Types of indexing:
1. Positive Indexing:- First character index value is 0 and eventually it increases till end. Index position moves from left to right.
2. Negative indexing:- We move from right to left. Generally this is used when we are unaware about the length of the string. Last character in a string can be accessed using negative indexing.

slicing: We can access no. of characters in one go. 
Syntax: Start(Starting index) : end(Ending Index)
Here the end index is not considered. We get till the end - 1 characters.
In negative indexing last index is not allowed.
We can use step parameter in the string.
Step cannot be negative when we are working with positive indexing.
[::-1] - use to reverse a string. '::' each colon indicates the start and end index to be accessed. As mention ':' it start from 0 index and get till last. we use -1 as step which help us to reverse string.

Editing & Deleting:
1. Editing
we cannot edit the single character in a string. It is immutable(it cannot be changed) data type.
We can completely re-assign to the string varible but cannot be edited and we cannot add new characters to the existing string.
2. Deletion:
we have a keyword del to remove the string stored in the variable. 
Note: Here the stored string is not getting deleted. Instead a whole variable is getting deleted. Strings cannot be deleted or edited as they are immutable.

Operations on string:
1. Arithmetic Operations
2. Relational Operations
3. Logical Operations
4. Loops on strings
5. Membership Operations (in, not in)

Arithmetic Operations:
+ In strings we use + operator to concatinate.
* We use this to multiply the string.

/ - These operators cannot be used in string operations.

Relational operators: == != can be use to compare strings.

> < :- used for string comparisions.
String comparision takes place based on Lexographical order.
In english Alphabets capital Letters come first and the small letters next.

Logical Operator: 
python consideration:
""(Empty strings) -> False
"Absh" (Non empty strings)-> True
useful for Logical operators.

"and" returns the first falsy value or the last value if all are truthy.
"or" returns the first truthy value.
Non-empty strings are truthy; empty strings are falsy.

Loops in string: We can apply sequencing and iteration on strings.
c = "Hello-world"
for i in c[::]:
    print(i)
print("H" in c)
print("Gidda" in c)
print("Hello" not in c)

String Functions:
1. Common Functions - applicable for list, set, tuple, dictionaries.
2. Specific Functions - these cannot be applied on list, tuples, dictionary, sets.

1.Common Functions:
a. len
b. max - Min & Max function in strings work on ASCII values.
c. min
d. sorted - sort the character based on ascending order and gives output in the form of list. To print the string in reverse order we give reverse parameter as True in sorted function.

2. Specific functions:
a. Capitalize/Title/Upper/Lower/Swapcase:
capitalize: this is used to convert the first letter of a word to capital.
b. Title: This capitalize the every first character of a word.
c. Upper: This converts the every character into upper case.
d. Lower: This converts the every character into lower case.
e. swapcase: converts the upper into lower and viceversa.
f. count: use to find the frequency of a sub string.
g. find: use to find the index of the character in a string.
h. index: use to find the location or index value of a substring.

The major difference between find and index is find function return -1 incase if the substring is not found.
index throws an error when the substring is not found.

i.endswith /startswith:
Both are use to check the  start or end of string using the given substring. This returns the bool value in presence or absence of substring.

j.format:
This is used when you are not aware about the input value. We provide empty spaces with braces to fill the gap in the braces.
Usecase: This is generally seen when we print the user name during login page.

syntax: Statements{} statement.format(values..)

Curly braces {} are the syntax Python uses to mark where values should be inserted in the string when using .format(). They act as "slots" for the values.

If we have no. of values in the format function. We can use the index of each value in the curly braces which will be identically replaced with the index values.
Indexing in format value starts from '0'.
we can assign varibales for the values in the format and use the same variables in the curly braces..
Note: It's not mandatory that we must use all the values present in the format function. 

6. isalnum/isalpha/isdecimal/isdigit/isidentifier:
These are the validation functions in python.
isalnum = either the string contains alphabets or numbers.
isalpha = it is used to validate the string contains alphabets.
isdecimal = it is used to validate the given integer is decimal.
isdigit = it is used to validate the given string is a integer.
isidentifier = It look for identifiers in the string.

7. split:
This is used to split the string. It convert string into list.

We can perform split operation based on different words. We can perform split based on space or any other word.

8. join:
This is used to join the list of words into a string.

9. replace:
This is use to replace a word in a string.
Here we specify both the words i.e. the word which need to replaced and the word we need to add.

10. strip:
It removes the trailing adn leaning spaces.

List & it's Operations:
1. What is list
2. list Vs Array
3. create
4. Access
5. Edit 
6. Delete 
7. Operations
8. Functions

Difference between list vs Array
1. Array is homogenous & list is Heterogenous. We can store different type of dataset in the list unlike array.
2. The elements in the Arrays are the stored in continous memeory location.
3. Arrays are much faster than list.Arrays help us in accessing the data through indexing due to efficient memory management and CPU caching.
4. List are programmer friendly.Building logic with list is more easier than arrays.

Creating a list in python:
a = []
List are created using square braces.
list can be homogenous & Heterogenous.
l = [1,2,3,4] - homogenous list
l = [name, 8, 0.9, 6+9j] - Heterogenous list

We can create a multi dimensional list:-
2D list - [1,,3,3,[4,5],[8,9],[10,7]]
3D list - [2,3,4,[[8,9],[0,3]],5,6,7,[[7,6],[4,3]]]

we can perform type conversion using list.
list("Hello")
output = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

The elements in the list can be accessed using the index. We have both negative and positive indexing in the list. we can get the range of numbers in the list. We can reverse the list. Accessing elements is similar to the strings. 

Note: Positive indexing refers to indexing from left to right.
Negative indexing refers to indexing from right to left.
reversing a list can be done using the [::-1].
i.e. we have specified start index, end index and step parameter. As negative index starts from right to left and we have mentioned only the starting point of negative index. This will give you a complete output from right to left.

Extracting elements from the multi dimensional list is same as the multi dimensional array indexing.

Editing list:
List in python are muttable(We can make changes to the elements in the list).
We can perform slicing on the list.

Adding:
We can add elements in the list using insert,Append, extend.
Append - Add one element to the end of list.
extend - we can add multiple elements to the end of the list. Ensure the multiple elements are given in the list format. If not they will be considered as strings.
insert - It takes two parameters (Index where we need to add the element, Element to be added) i.e.(index, element)

Deletion in list:
1. del
2. remove
3. pop
4. clear

del - we can delete the complete list or an element from the list using del keyword.
remove - we can remove the element from the list by directly specifying it.
pop - delete the last element from the list.
clear - it does not delete the list instead it will clear all the elements present in the list i.e. it makes list empty with no elements.

Operations in list:
concatination: We can join both the lists.
Multiply: We can multiply the list.
l1 * 3 will result in list elements will be appeared for 3 times.
we can use list as sequence in for loop.

Funcitons in list:
1. len
2. min
3. max
4. sorted - this is not the permanent operation.
5. sort  - This is permanent operation.
6. index - this is used to find the index of a number.

Tuples:
1. create
2. Access
3. Edit
4. Add
5. Delete
6. Operations
7. Functions

1. Creating Tuples:
Tuples are created using round braces.
homogenous Tuples: The tuple in which all the data types are same.
Heterogenous tuples: The tuple in which all the data types are not same.
we can create a 2D tuple.
NOTE: when we want to create a tuple of single element we need to write comma after writing the element. This make that variable tuple. If not it display the data type of the variable declared.

We use tuple by using type conversion.
We can convert string & list into tuple.

2. Access elements:
Everything is similar to list.
we can use indexing & silicing to access the elements from the tuple.
In 2D tuples we can use 2D indexing to access the element.

3. Editing:
Tuples are immutable(Once created cannot be changed)
NOTE: The major difference between list & tuple is tuples as like strings are immutable.

    t[0]= 100
    ~^^^
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment 

4. Add: We cannot add new items to the tuple.
NOTE: TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE.

5. Delelting:
we can delete the complete tuple but single element cannot be deleted from the tuple.
NOTE: TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE.

6. Operations: similar to list.
 concatinate, Multiply, loop

7. Funcitons:
len, min, max, sum, sorted, 
sorted(<listname>, reverse = True) - this will give you a reverse tuple.

Tuples are read-only data types. This help us to protect the integrity of the data. 

Sets:
Rules in sets:
1. Sets does not allow duplicates
2. Sets have no indexing/slicing
3. Sets don't allow mutable data types.
4. Set itself is a mutable data type.

NOTE: Set inside set is not allowed. Therefore, 2D & 3D sets are not possible.

1. create
2. Access
3. Edit
4. Add
5. Delete
6. Operations
7. Functions

1. Create:
Whenever we try to create a empty set and assign curly braces. We think set is created but when we check it using type function. We get it's type as dictionary. 
NOTE: In Python curly braces{} are used for dictionaries.
To create a empty set we use set() function.
homogenous & Heterogenous sets are possible.

Sets does not follow indexing. It follows hashing.
ex:-
s = {"hello", 1, 2, 3,4}
print("Heterogenous sets:",s)
output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 'hello'}

sets allow tuples as there element but not list.

Reason: 
Sets in Python can only contain immutable (unchangeable) objects as their elements. This is because sets use hashing to store elements, and only immutable objects can have a fixed hash value.
Tuples are immutable.
Using tuple in set: {4, 5, (1, 2, 3, 3), 6}

Lists are mutable.
  print("Using list in set:",{[1,2,3,4], 5,6,7})
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

Trying to create a multi dimensional set.
s = {{1},{2},4,5}
print("2D set:",s)

 s = {{1},{2},4,5}
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'

2. Accessing:
Set doesnot support positive/negative indexing & silicing.

print("Accessing element through positive indexing:",s2[0])
# print("Accessing element through negative indexing:", s2[-1])
# print("Accessing element through slicing:",s2[0:3])

output: 
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

3. Editing: It is considered when the memory location is same.
Editing is not possible in sets. 

NOTE: There is a possibilty that we convert the set into list and then edit the element then add back to the set. This is not considered as editing becoz the address changes.

4. Add:
We can add elements in the set using add method.

5. Delete:
This can be performed using three keywords: del, remove, pop
del - it can remove complete set but we cannot remove single element using it's index.
remove - we can remove the element from the set by specifing the value in remove function.
pop - this will delete the last element based on hashing. 
NOTE: In all other data types it deletes the last element but when it comes to set it delete the elements based on hashing.

Set operations:
No concatination.
No multiplication.
Loop & Membership operator(in, not in) can be applied for set.

Funcitons: len, min, max, sum, sorted.

min & max - used only when the set is homogenous set.
sorted(<set name>, reverse = True) - use to print the set in reverse order.

We can perform all set operations on set.
Union - we can perform union operation on sets where the final set contains only unique integers. 
syntax: <set1 varibale> Union(<set2 varibale>)


Intersection - we can get the common elements of two sets.
syntax: <set1 varibale> Intersection(<set2 vairable>)

Difference - use to find the unique elements which are not in one set. [The items which are present in set1 but are NOT present in set2]
syntax: <set1 variable> Difference(<set2 varibale>)

Symmetric Difference - These are the elements which are not common in both the sets. [Here the elements of both the sets are present except the common elements from both the sets].

Disjoint - When we do not have any common elements between the two sets.
Note: We use isdisjoint method.

subset - a set whose all elements are also present in another set.
Note: We use issubset method.

superset - a set that contains all the elements of another set.
Note: We use issuperset method.
