Dynamic Typing:
We need NOT to specify the data type. Unlike the other languages where we specifically mention the data type for a variable.

python supports Dynamic typing where we need to specify the data type explicitly.

Static typing: Viceversa of Dynamic typing. we need to specify the data type of the vairable which indicates the data we store in that variable.

Keywords:

Python is a case sensitive programming language.

In programming a keyword is a word that is reserved by a program bcoz the word has a seperate meaning. Keywords can be commands or parameters. Every programming language has a set of Keywords that cannot be used as variable names.

Python provides a module called keyword (note the lowercase "k") that contains a list of reserved keywords in Python.

There are 33 keywords in python.
Keywords list include:
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Using these keywords as variable names will result in errors.

Identifier:
Python Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
Rules for setting Identifier:
1. Only start with alphabet or _(Down slash)
2. Followed by 0 or more letter,_ and digits
3. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

Types of software:
1. Static software (Uni Directional)
2. Dynamic software //This highlights the importance of input function which help us to take into input from the user.

Whenever we use input function the programmer will always get the input in the form of string.

Type function:
This will help us to know about the data type of the value which we give.

Type conversions:
1. Implicit 
2. Explicit 

int function:
This can be used to convert data type into integer.
Strings with float value cannot be converted into integer.

Ex: int(4.5) this throws an error.
Type conversions are not permanent operations.


Literals:
It is a raw data given to a variable. In python we have four types of literals. They are:
1. Numeric literal
2. String literal
3. Boolean literal
4. Special literal

Numeric Literal:
a. integer
b. float
c. complex

String literals:
a. Single quotes
b. Double quotes
c. Triple quotes //These are used to print multi line text.
There is no particular data type called char in python. Everything in python is considered as string.
Unicode strings are accepted by python. we need to specify the unicode with "u".
Raw string can be printed in python. Generally raw string is used when we want to print html code which consist of many special characters.

Boolean literal:
True indicates '1'.
False indicates '0'.
a = True + 4 //We encounter a Implicit type conversion which result in the value of a as 5.
b = False + 10 //the value of false is Implicitly taken as '0' and the value of b is 10.

Special literal
a = None There is no vairable declaration in py. we use this when we want to declare a varibale and assign none so that ntg is stored in it. This variable remains ideal yet we can use it in future advancements. This is generally helpful in the scenario when we are working with team.

For instance your manager may ask you to declare a variable which he might use later. 
When we declare 0 or anyother value there is a risk of error in our logic. To avoid such situations we use None.
